            BRINGUPS (also known as Reminders) are a brilliant way to keep a list before you of the items and plans you have made which
            require you to follow up, stay in touch, respond, whatever - the uses are endless. In reality, however, they are merely
            a SUB-SET of 'Discussion' records, selected from across ALL accounts.<br/><br/>
            
            If you've previously read the 'Discussions' Help section, you will know that Discussion records enable you to keep a record
            of who was contacted (and when and how), plus unlimited notes of calls, visits, conversations, licence renewals, etc., and
            that they also provide a Bringup Date.<br/><br/>
            
            These are usually set when you create each Discussion record (default is 2 days hence), and will show ALL incomplete tasks
            that are due now (or within the next 2 days), or are overdue.<br/><br/>
            
            You can change any Bringup Date to any future date you like, at any time.<br/><br/>
            
            You can avoid being reminded by simply clicking on the Bringup Date, so it switches to 'Complete' and immediately disappears
            from your Bringup list. You can 'undo' this if required but, to find it, you will first need to go to that Account's 'Discussions'
            records (where it will appear as 'complete'). Simply click on it to restore it to active again.<br/><br/>
            
            As your negotiations progress, you can update the Notes field as often as you like.<br/><br/>
            
            This list starts with the OLDEST tasks due but not yet completed (not just the latest ones), so you may need to scroll down if you
            have a lot of current activities, or if you fall behind and the list gets long.<br/><br/>
            
            Remember that, because Bringups are drawn from ALL Accounts, they are accessed from a button at the top of the ACCOUNTS (i.e. first) screen.
