            ACCOUNTS are organisations that you communicate with. First, 'Tap here to add new',
            then choose an organisation you know and enter their basic details (an 'Account Name' at the very least).<br/><br/>
            
            Don't worry about completing the whole page immediately. Just complete the first line or two, then click on the 'All Contacts' button,
            where you can enter your first 'Contact' (i.e. person). Once you have added details of at least one Contact, return to the 'Account' screen
            and take advantage of the shortcuts by clicking on the arrow to the right of the 'Primary Contact' data box, and choosing one of the Contacts
            you entered a moment ago. Repeat the process for Secondary, Billing and Accounts contact fields if you wish.<br/><br/>
            
            The 'Discussions' buttons will also be useful later (after you have entered some data), but skip them for a moment,
            while you set up the rest of the 'Account'.<br/><br/>
            
            <u>Line 2: A Very Special Field</u><br/>
            This label can be changed to read anything you choose. For instance, you might want a 'Legal Name', or you might prefer a 'Project Name'.
            Click on the arrow to see a dropdown list, which you can edit or add to. It's up to you.<br/><br/>
            
            <u>Entering Phone Numbers</u><br/>
            <u>iPhones</u><br/>
            Enter your phone numbers with <u>at least</u> a local prefix, such as 03 (e.g. 03-123 4567). You may include spaces, hyphens, brackets or even nothing if you prefer. You call will be placed through your usual carrier.<br/><br/>
            When you complete any call, exit the phone software using the button at the bottom of your screen, then click on your ACDB icon to re-start it, when it will re-open at your original position. You can then make notes of your conversation by clicking on the 'Discussions' button. Note: We suggest you locate your ACDB icon at the centre of the bottom row of your screen to make access even easier.<br/><br/>
            
            <u>iPads</u><br/>
            Phone numbers entered into ACDB on iPads <u>must</u> include the international prefix used in your country (e.g. 00-61-3-1234 5678, or 0011-61-3-1234 5678)<br/>
            To use your iPad to place calls to a regular phone or mobile, you will need a SIM card and data plan (you may already have one, e.g. from Vodafone).<br/>
            You will also need a Skype account (downloadable from the App Store for free), and to purchase a small amount of Skype Credit (currently from US$10.00)<br/><br/>
            When you complete any call, exit the phone software using the button at the bottom of your screen, then click on your ACDB icon to re-start it, when it will re-open at your original position. You can then make notes of your conversation by clicking on the 'Discussions' button. Note: We suggest you locate your ACDB icon at the centre of the bottom row of your screen to make access even easier.<br/><br/>
            
            Note: If you don't have Skype installed, attempts to dial from your iPad will fail, and you will be presented with a 'Skype for iPad' screen, which includes Skype's miniature 'cloud' icon. Clicking on that proceeds to download Skype, after which you need to create an account, or sign in if you already have one.<br/><br/>
            
            Disclaimer: Please note that, while this worked perfectly in our lab at time of release, we cannot accept responsibility for Skype issues or policy changes, nor can we guarantee that it will work in your situation. Skype have excellent website support - look up 'What is Skype Credit and where can I buy it?' (https://support.skype.com/faq/FA570/)<br/><br/>
            
            <u>Entering Addresses</u><br/>
            When you first reach the two empty address areas, you will be asked for the Country <u>before</u> entering the Street, etc., so
            that the field names used can be matched to your country. If your country is not shown, you can add it yourself.<br/><br/>
            
            <u>Other Fields</u><br/>
            The four 'AccUserDef' fields are yours to use for almost any Account information you like. Re-label them to suit your own
            needs by clicking on the arrow to the right of the current label.<br/><br/>
            
            The Notes field at the bottom is for unlimited data (subject to hardware limitations) about the organisation.
            Use this for "permanent" notes and reminders - don't confuse it with 'Discussions', which are stored by date.<br/><br/>
            
            As your data is stored on your phone, there is no need to be concerned about staying within range of a cellphone tower.<br/><br/>
            
            <u>How to Back Up Your Data</u><br/>
            Backup is provided via your iTunes software on a local computer. Regular backup is essential for your own protection.
            The authors cannot accept responsibility for data loss however caused, so PLEASE BACK UP REGULARLY!<br/><br/>
            
            1. Plug your iPhone or iPad into your computer via your usual USB connector. iTunes will open automatically. Note that this will start a Synch process which can sometimes take several minutes.<br/>
            
            2. If necessary, press Ctrl-S (or click on View, Show Sidebar) so that you have a menu on the left side of the computer screen.<br/>
            3. Select your iPhone or iPad under 'Devices', then select 'Apps' from the menu across the top of the screen.<br/>
            4. Scroll down to the File Sharing section, where you will see various apps listed.<br/>
            5. Click on ACDB and a list of several ACDB files will appear on the right side of the screen, under ACDB Documents.<br/>
            6. Select all of these files and click on 'Save to...'. You can then choose where to store this data on your computer, e.g. you might like to create a special directory called 'ACDB backups' (be sure to confirm your success).<br/><br/>
            
            <u>Restoring Your Data from Backup</u><br/>
            Follow the backup process above as far as Line 5, then...<br/>
            6. Select those same files and click 'Add' to restore them to your device.<br/><br/>
            
            <u>Updating your ACDB software</u><br/>
            If you receive advice of a revised version then, BEFORE commencing an update, back up your data as described above, to protect against mishap.
            Do NOT delete the program from your device, or you will lose all ACDB data from it.<br/>
            Next, download the new version using the instructions provided with it. Your data should remain available as previously. If you do lose it,
            you can restore from your latest backup as per the previous paragraph.<br/><br/>
            
            <u>Re-installing ACDB</u><br/>
            If the program becomes corrupted, or you accidentally delete it, then you will need to re-install the program itself.
            Follow the instructions provided with your original or later software then, once it has been re-installed, follow the
            section above: 'Restoring Your Data from Backup'.<br/><br/>
            
            Finally... Remember to BACK UP OFTEN!
