            CONTACTS are people associated with an 'Account' (or organisation).<br/><br/>
            
            After you have set up a basic Account (an Account Name at the very least), click on the 'All Contacts' button.
            This will show you a Contact selection screen - simply click on the bottom line ('Tap here to add new') to be presented with
            a blank 'Contact' entry screen.<br/><br/>
            
            FirstName: Enter a 'formal' first name, such as you might use in the address. It can be more than one word (e.g. James, Jean-Paul).<br/>
            Lastnames: Last names, or surnames, can be more than one word (e.g. Da Silva). You may leave this blank if necessary.<br/>
            Nicknames: Optionally, add a nickname that you might use every day (e.g. Jim, JP). You can leave this blank if preferred.<br/>
            Salutations: While many people no longer use Mr/Mrs/Ms/Miss (as some people object to their use), it is often considered courteous to include
            'distinguished' Salutations like Dr, Sir, Lady, Lord, etc. It's only a reminder, and entirely your call. Leave this blank if you wish.<br/><br/>
            
            How do you deal with people who are NOT really related to any organisation? Easy.<br/>
            An 'Account' can be anything that suits you, e.g. 'Johnsons', or 'Robertson family', or 'Walking Group', or 'Smith, Peter'.<br/><br/>
            
            If you do use an individual's name, however, you should also create them as a Contact as well (e.g. 'Peter Smith'), so you can take advantage of
            the various Contact fields. In such cases, create the Account using a 'Surname, Firstname' format to minimise confusion between Account
            (organisation) and Contact (person).<br/><br/>
            
            Some fields require use of a drop-down or other data input box - these are easily seen by the arrows on the right hand edge of the screen.<br/><br/>
            
            The 'Chn &amp; Birthdays' and 'Hobbies' fields are both multi-line and will expand to cope with almost anything you wish to enter.<br/><br/>
            
            The four 'ConUserDef' fields are yours to use for almost any Contact info you like. Use the arrow at the end of the label to re-label
            them to suit your own needs.<br/><br/>
            
            The Notes field at the bottom is for unlimited data (subject to hardware limitations) about the Contact (i.e. the person). Use this for 'permanent'
            notes - don't confuse it with Discussions, which are stored by date.<br/><br/>
            
            Once you have entered as much as you want to for now, click on the Account button at the top to return to the Account.<br/><br/>
            
            Now you can click on, say, 'Primary' and choose one of those Contacts you entered to be your Primary Contact, and ditto Secondary,
            Billing or Accounts Contact. Then they will be two clicks away from your call, text or email options!
