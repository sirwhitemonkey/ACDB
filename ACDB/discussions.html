            DISCUSSIONS are records of unlimited length (subject to hardware limitations) which enable you to keep records by
            Account (organisation) of contact dates, who was contacted (and how), plus unlimited notes of calls, visits, conversations,
            annual or passport renewals, etc.<br/><br/>
            
            When you select an Account and click on the blue Discussions button part way down the page, you will see a list of ALL Discussions
            for that one Account only. Click on any of interest to open them for closer reading or to add or edit information. Alternatively,
            you can click on the blue 'New Discussion' button to commence a new one if desired.<br/><br/>
            
            The 'Type Of Contact' field uses a drop-down list which you can modify if desired. You can add more options by clicking on the bottom row of text reading 'Tap here to add new', or you can remove options by using the
            Edit button.<br/><br/>
            
            Obviously, to select a 'Contact Person', they must first exist in the Contact list for that Account.<br/><br/>
            
            The first date in each record is the date it was created (you can edit it if you wish). The second date is an automatic
            'Bringup Date' - great if you want a reminder later! This defaults to 2 days ahead, but you can edit this to any date at
            any time (maybe for a renewal even 3 years out - it's your life!), or you can simply click on it and it will switch to read
            'complete' (click again to undo this if you choose).<br/><br/>
            
            At the bottom of the detail is a 'Notes' space, where lengthy detailed notes (limited only by hardware) may be recorded.<br/><br/>
            
            All Discussions are retained indefinitely (including all 'complete' ones), though only the most recent are visible on-screen.
            Scroll up to see older discussions if required.
